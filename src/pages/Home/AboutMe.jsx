            As a recent graduate with a robust understanding of computer science principles and coursework, I
possess a dynamic skill set that includes proficiency in full-stack development, UI/UX design, and
front-end development using technologies like the MERN stack and ReactJS. Through my freelancing
experience, I have cultivated strong communication skills, motivation, and efficient time management. Additionally, I have worked extensively with Java, particularly in backend development using the
Spring framework.
            </p>
            <p className="hero--section-description">
            This experience has not only enhanced my ability to interact effectively with
clients but has also equipped me with the technical expertise needed to integrate Java with the Spring
framework, further diversifying my skill set. I am enthusiastic about applying these skills in a
collaborative environment, where I aim to leverage my networking abilities to forge valuable
connections and contribute meaningfully to impactful projects.
